*It is necessary to use the Oculus Rift(HMD) and controllers*

The main task of the game is to throw the ball and kill the characters to earn scores. killing all of the
characters means, you have won the game. You can see the earning scores leveled as "Count" while you are in VR(wearing HMD).
After collecting all of the boxes, "Congratulations,you win!" text message will be appeared to confirm your winning.

In practice, It is not easy to kill all of the characters. Because there are few barriers which makes it 
harder. while playing the game, be aware of not hitting the "Blue boxes" and the two human characters. Because, every time
when the Ball collide with the human or with the blue boxes, The game starts from the beginning, means you will loss all of the
scores which you have earned previously.
